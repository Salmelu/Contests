<p><b>Contests</b> is a small java project created to help with organizing some contests.</p>
<p>It is designed to ease the calculation of various competition's results and provide an easy user interface. It is also written as a client-server application, allowing multiple clients to use the same set of data.</p>
<p>The project uses an external library called <a href="http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/" alt="ControlsFX library">ControlsFX</a> which adds JavaFX missing features like popup dialogs and multiple choice comboboxes.</p>
<p>The <i>server</i> part is written as a console application and provides no user interface and allows no interaction with the running program, except for a shutdown hook, which is implemented to allow a comfortable shutdown</p>
<p>The <i>client</i> part uses <i>JavaFX</i> to display graphical user interface and communicates with the server using TCP sockets to obtain and change server's data.</p>
